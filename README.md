The Open Magister API
=================

The Open Magister API is a project that aims to make the Magister application suite open for developers. Magister is Silverlight client for the school management software of Schoolmaster. Students use it to view their timetables, grades and more.

***This project is in an active state and is expected to yield results soon. For now, it cannot yet be used to effectively communicate with schoolmaster servers.***
